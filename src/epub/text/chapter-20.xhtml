			<p>“John said he was going to Benton Harbor today,” Nannie observed to Lucy, who was seated near a window, darning Dimmie’s socks. She had just washed her hair and come down to the sunny dining room to dry it.</p>
			<p>“Did he?” Lucy raised her eyes in involuntary surprise, but glanced quickly down at her sewing.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” continued Nannie, seating herself in a comfortable rocker. “He is going to see somebody about a house decoration contract.”</p>
			<p>“Well, he’ll be back for dinner, won’t he?” Lucy inquired.</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes. But he’ll be late, he said. He wanted me to go with him but I was afraid of getting seasick. It’s a beautiful day after all, though!” and she gazed out the window regretfully. “I have to look through a trunk, anyway,” she added, as if comforting herself.</p>
			<p>“I didn’t know he was going,” said Lucy.</p>
			<p>“He was worried last night and I guess he forgot to tell you.”</p>
			<p>Lucy began to sew with renewed determination.</p>
			<p>“I was right sorry for John last night,” Mrs. Merwent declared. “You should be more careful what you say, Lucy.”</p>
			<p>“What do you mean, Mamma? What have I said?”</p>
			<p>“Why, things that make John feel that—that—why, about Mr. Sprague.”</p>
			<p>“What about him?”</p>
			<p>Nannie’s gaze fell before Lucy’s.</p>
			<p>“Nothing in particular, except that you show so plainly that you⁠⁠⸺”</p>
			<p>“That I what?” Lucy demanded almost fiercely.</p>
			<p>“Well, that you are interested in him,” murmured Nannie, with attempted calmness, adding at once, “of course I know<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span> that there is nothing between you and Mr. Sprague, but you should consider⁠⁠⸺” She stopped abruptly.</p>
			<p>“Consider what my husband might think, I suppose,” interrupted Lucy hotly.</p>
			<p>“Well, when you take his part against John and me you must admit that you give people a right to think things.”</p>
			<p>“You, and not John, were the one who tried to queer Jim, and I would have taken the part of anyone under the circumstances,” returned Lucy indignantly, “and if you want to think evil of it, you can do so.”</p>
			<p>“Well, John agreed with everything I said,” defended Nannie.</p>
			<p>“Then, if he wants to think badly of me, he can too!” Lucy exclaimed angrily. “It would evidently suit you if he did.”</p>
			<p>“How can you say that, Lucy, when I was trying to save you from just such things! That’s the gratitude a mother gets—especially if she’s forgiven a lot in her child,” complained Nannie in a tremulous voice.</p>
			<p>“Most of the evil you are always so anxious to save me from only exists in your own mind, Mamma. I would be much more grateful if you would quit thinking of nasty things to forgive me for,” retorted Lucy bitterly.</p>
			<p>“Well,” replied Mrs. Merwent, “I’m sure I’ve done my duty. I didn’t want John to get suspicious, but⁠⁠⸺”</p>
			<p>“That’s why you keep suggesting vile interpretations of innocent things to him!” interpolated Lucy disgustedly, springing to her feet and gathering up her mending.</p>
			<p>“Why, Lucy,” began Nannie, on the verge of tears. But Lucy went into the hall, and ascended the stairs.</p>
			<p>A few moments later she returned with her hat and coat on.</p>
			<p>“I’m going out,” she announced. Her voice was harsh. She paused in the doorway.</p>
			<p>Nannie looked up and met her daughter’s eyes uncomfortably.</p>
			<p>“Where are you going?” she asked finally, pulling at the handkerchief in her lap with uncertain fingers.</p>
			<p>“I’m going to see Jim.”</p>
			<p>“Lucy!” gasped Mrs. Merwent as the front door closed after her daughter.</p>
			<p>Jim was alone and hard at work when Lucy reached the office.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span> The windows were open and a breeze fluttered the papers on his desk.</p>
			<p>“Sit down,” he invited, leaning back in his chair and reaching for his pipe. “How are you all getting along at your house? Where’s the kid?”</p>
			<p>“Dimmie’s at kindergarten.”</p>
			<p>“Didn’t know he’d started to go,” said Jim.</p>
			<p>“Lots of things have happened since you were out,” remarked Lucy quietly.</p>
			<p>“Yes?” Jim lighted his pipe.</p>
			<p>Lucy did not say more and Jim smoked a moment in silence.</p>
			<p>“What is it, Lucy? Are you worried about something?” he inquired at last, blowing out a cloud of smoke.</p>
			<p>Lucy nodded her head without speaking.</p>
			<p>“Well, women always worry about one of two things, money, or another woman,” pursued Jim in a bantering tone. “Which is it?”</p>
			<p>“Both,” said Lucy seriously.</p>
			<p>Jim looked grave, and when he spoke again it was with a different manner.</p>
			<p>“Can I help, Lucy?”</p>
			<p>“I think you can, Jim. That’s why I’ve come.”</p>
			<p>He waited for her to go on.</p>
			<p>“John is spending too much, Jim, and Mamma encourages him in it,” Lucy began, rather suddenly, “and things are—are so I can’t do anything. I thought maybe if you—suggested to John—it might⁠⁠⸺” Lucy’s voice trailed off in embarrassment, and she opened and shut her purse nervously.</p>
			<p>“I will,” Jim promised earnestly. “You can depend on me, Lucy.”</p>
			<p>“I know I can, Jim.”</p>
			<p>“And, Lucy⁠⁠⸺”</p>
			<p>“Yes?”</p>
			<p>“About the money. If your expenses have swamped you—you know I have something laid up. My living costs me very little, and you are awfully welcome to what I have.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you, Jim, but you know I couldn’t take any money. Besides, we don’t need it yet, but I am frightened at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span> amount we are spending.”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t mean—I mean you could pay it back if you wanted to.” Jim was very red.</p>
			<p>“I understand, Jim, but it isn’t necessary.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t see what’s gotten into John!” he ejaculated with feeling.</p>
			<p>“It isn’t John,” said Lucy, “it’s Mamma.”</p>
			<p>“Well, he ought to know⁠⁠⸺” Jim stopped speaking and glanced at Lucy.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Jim, but so had she.”</p>
			<p>Jim thought.</p>
			<p>“Do you know yet if she’s going to stay—permanently?” he inquired after a pause.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know, Jim. I shouldn’t be surprised. She talks sometimes as though she were eventually going to marry a Professor Walsh, back in Russellville. But I don’t know.”</p>
			<p>Jim smoked hard for a while. When he spoke again his voice was low.</p>
			<p>“Lucy, you know I would do anything in the world for you,” he said. “Anything,” he repeated vehemently.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Jim. You are the best friend that ever was.” Lucy smiled at him frankly. “But I don’t see just how you can help in anything else.”</p>
			<p>“I’d like to help,” he offered, almost wistfully.</p>
			<p>“You have,” she declared, still smiling. “I feel a lot better already.”</p>
			<p>“Do you, Lucy?” he asked eagerly. “Do I—do you—am I⁠⁠⸺” he stammered, growing red again.</p>
			<p>“Why, of course you do,” she responded heartily and naturally. “It always does me good to talk to you.” Then she added rather plaintively, “Oh, Jim, why can’t people be honest with themselves and with others?”</p>
			<p>“I’m damned if I know!” he declared savagely, not looking at her.</p>
			<p>“I’m sure I don’t either,” she said, regarding him affectionately. “Well, good-bye. I’m going home.” She rose and shook hands.</p>
			<p>“Good-bye, Lucy. You can depend on me.” Jim held her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span> hand.</p>
			<p>“Thank you, Jim,” she answered, pressing his hand.</p>
			<p>And she was gone.</p>
			<hr class="tb"/>
			<p>Mrs. Merwent was at the piano, practising, when Lucy reached home.</p>
			<p>“Well, did you see Mr. Sprague?” Nannie asked sarcastically, going into the hall when she heard the front door open.</p>
			<p>“Yes,” returned Lucy calmly.</p>
			<p>“You ought to be careful, Lucy,” reminded Nannie. “Of course <em>I</em> wouldn’t say anything to John, but others might.”</p>
			<p>“You can say anything you like to him,” retorted Lucy in a disgusted tone. “I’m going to tell him myself.”</p>
			<p>That night John returned late. Nannie, Lucy, and Dimmie had finished their evening meal, and Lucy had tucked Dimmie safely into bed, when the front door clicked and a cheerful voice was heard in the hall.</p>
			<p>“Now, Lucy, your croaking was all for nothing,” were John’s first words. “Look there!” he commanded, rushing into the living room and throwing a pile of bills on the table, his manner almost hilarious.</p>
			<p>“How nice!” murmured Nannie.</p>
			<p>“Where did that come from?” Lucy inquired quickly.</p>
			<p>“Why, Jim put over a deal today while I was away, and this is my share of the lucre,” and John put his hands in his pockets and began to whistle.</p>
			<p>“What kind of a deal was it?” persisted Lucy.</p>
			<p>“Oh, some private scheme of his. Sold building materials or something on commission,” answered John.</p>
			<p>Lucy looked nonplussed.</p>
			<p>“Didn’t Mr. Sprague say anything to you about it?” Nannie inquired of Lucy in an innocent voice.</p>
			<p>“Why, was Jim out here today?” asked John in surprise.</p>
			<p>“No. I was at the office,” Lucy explained without hesitation.</p>
			<p>“Why, he didn’t tell me,” said John, as though mystified. Then, apologetically, “I was only there a minute, Lucy. Went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span> to Benton Harbor on business. I forgot to say anything about going last night.”</p>
			<p>“Your dinner’s getting cold,” was all Lucy’s reply.</p>
			<p>As John seated himself at the table a faint cry was heard from the upper floor and Lucy, exclaiming, “That’s Dimmie!” left the room quickly.</p>
			<p>“John, I wish you would ask Mr. Sprague out again,” requested Nannie, when she thought her daughter was safely upstairs.</p>
			<p>John looked teasingly at her.</p>
			<p>“What’s the matter? Are you getting lonesome, or just yearning for more of Jim’s society?”</p>
			<p>“Will you ask him out?” she repeated.</p>
			<p>“Yes. Of course I will. Let’s see. Today is Tuesday. I’ll bring him out Thursday night. He’s going to work late tomorrow, I heard him say.”</p>
			<p>“Now, don’t forget,” warned Nannie.</p>
